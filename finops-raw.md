== FinOps in Azure Databricks ==

Financial Operations (FinOps) in Azure Databricks is the practice of managing, monitoring, and optimizing cloud spending for data engineering, data science, and analytics workloads. It enables organizations to:
* Gain visibility into Azure Databricks costs and usage.
* Enforce guardrails that maintain compliance and cost control.
* Optimize resource consumption through proactive cost governance.

=== Key Policies and Guidelines ===

==== Interactive Cluster Policy ====
* '''Purpose''': Manage ad hoc or exploratory workloads in notebooks.
* '''Common Guardrails''': 
  * Limit the maximum cluster size, runtime versions, and expensive instance types.
* '''Tags''':
  * <code>project_team</code>: Specify the project team responsible for the cluster.
  * <code>cost_center</code>: Specify the cost center associated with the cluster.

==== Job Cluster Policy ====
* '''Purpose''': Schedule or automate pipelines (e.g., ETL jobs, data processing).
* '''Common Guardrails''': 
  * Include maximum node counts, auto-scaling limits, and instance configurations.
* '''Tags''':
  * <code>project_team</code>: Specify the project team responsible for the job cluster.
  * <code>cost_center</code>: Specify the cost center associated with the job cluster.

==== Budget Policies for Services ====
* '''Purpose''': Monitor and optimize costs where Databricks handles the infrastructure behind the scenes.
* '''Common Guardrails''': 
  * Include budget limitations based on services and usage.
* '''Tags''':
  * <code>project_team</code>: Specify the project team responsible for the services workload.
  * <code>cost_center</code>: Specify the cost center associated with the services workload.
