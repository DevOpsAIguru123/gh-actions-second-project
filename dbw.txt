Here’s a revised and more structured version of the description and acceptance criteria:

Description:

Create an initial draft outlining the mechanisms for managing FinOps on the Databricks platform. The objective is to identify various cost parameters, optimize resource utilization, and establish best practices. The focus areas include:
	•	Classic Compute Usage: Optimization strategies for fixed compute clusters.
	•	Serverless Compute Usage: Efficient scaling and cost control measures.
	•	Storage Usage: Best practices for minimizing storage costs while ensuring performance.
	•	Identification of other usage components contributing to cost, such as networking, monitoring, and job scheduling.

This draft should serve as the foundation for implementing a cost-efficient FinOps strategy tailored for Databricks.

Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	Best Practices Document: A document summarizing best practices for managing costs in the following areas:
	•	Classic Compute Usage
	•	Serverless Compute Usage
	•	Storage Usage
	2.	Analysis of Cost Parameters: Identification and explanation of key cost drivers and usage components within the Databricks platform.
	3.	Recommendations: Actionable recommendations for cost optimization, including scaling strategies, resource tagging, and monitoring approaches.
	4.	Supporting Data: Inclusion of real-world examples, benchmarks, or metrics to validate the proposed best practices.
