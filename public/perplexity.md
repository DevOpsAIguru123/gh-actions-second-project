# Comprehensive Databricks Platform Usage Dashboard Strategy

Creating effective Databricks platform usage dashboards requires leveraging both **system tables** and **information schema** to provide stakeholders with comprehensive insights into billing, object usage, and operational trends[1][2]. Based on the extensive system tables available in Azure Databricks and the information schema capabilities, here's a strategic approach to building impactful dashboards.

## Essential Dashboard Categories

### 1. **Billing and Cost Management Dashboards**

The most critical dashboards for stakeholders focus on cost optimization and billing transparency using the `system.billing.usage` and `system.billing.list_prices` tables[1][3].

**Key Metrics to Include:**
- Daily spend per compute type over time (Jobs, SQL, All-Purpose, DLT, Model Inference)[4][5]
- Cost comparison between current and previous 30-day periods[5]
- Weekly cost change percentages and trending analysis[4][5]
- Cost allocation by workspace, team, and user[6][3]
- Most expensive jobs and resource consumers[5]
- DBU consumption patterns across different SKUs[6][3]

**Stakeholder Value:** Provides immediate visibility into cost drivers and enables proactive budget management through pre-built usage dashboards that account admins can import directly[7][8].

### 2. **Object Usage and Access Analytics Dashboards**

Utilizing the information schema and audit logs to track data asset utilization and access patterns[2][9].

**Core Components:**
- Table and view access frequency using `system.access.audit`[1][10]
- Most frequently accessed catalogs, schemas, and tables[2][11]
- User activity patterns and workspace utilization[1][10]
- Data lineage visualization from `system.access.table_lineage` and `system.access.column_lineage`[1][12]
- Catalog and schema growth trends over time[2][13]

**Implementation Focus:** Track which data assets are actively used versus those consuming storage without value, enabling data governance decisions[14][15].

### 3. **Compute Performance and Efficiency Dashboards**

Monitor compute resource utilization and performance trends using compute-related system tables[1][16].

**Essential Metrics:**
- Cluster utilization from `system.compute.node_timeline`[1][17]
- SQL warehouse performance from `system.compute.warehouse_events`[1][17]
- Job execution trends from `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline`[1][18]
- Memory and CPU utilization patterns[16][5]
- Cluster scaling and autoscaling effectiveness[1][19]
- Query performance analysis from `system.query.history`[1][20]

**Optimization Insights:** Identify underutilized resources, optimal cluster configurations, and performance bottlenecks[19][21].

### 4. **Security and Compliance Monitoring Dashboards**

Leverage audit logs and access patterns for security oversight and compliance reporting[9][22].

**Security Metrics:**
- User authentication and access patterns from `system.access.audit`[1][9]
- Failed login attempts and security incidents[9][23]
- Data access by external users or service principals[1][22]
- Privilege escalation events and administrative actions[9][15]
- Network access events from `system.access.outbound_network`[1][17]

**Compliance Features:** Automated audit trail generation and anomaly detection for regulatory requirements[22][15].

### 5. **Operational Health and Trends Dashboards**

Monitor platform health and identify operational trends using multiple system tables[1][14].

**Operational Indicators:**
- Job success/failure rates from `system.lakeflow.job_tasks`[1][18]
- Pipeline health from `system.lakeflow.pipelines`[1][17]
- Assistant usage patterns from `system.access.assistant_events`[1][17]
- Model serving endpoint performance from `system.serving.endpoint_usage`[1][24]
- Data quality monitoring trends[25][26]

## Advanced Dashboard Capabilities

### **AI-Powered Analytics Integration**

Databricks recommends using **AI/BI dashboards** (formerly Lakeview dashboards) for enhanced visualization capabilities[27][28]. These dashboards support:
- AI-assisted authoring for complex visualizations[27][28]
- Up to 100 datasets per dashboard with 10 pages and 100 widgets[27][28]
- Real-time data refresh and embedded credentials for broader sharing[4][28]

### **Custom Metrics and Alerting**

Implement proactive monitoring through:
- Budget alerts based on usage thresholds[21][6]
- Performance degradation notifications[18][19]
- Data quality anomaly detection[26][15]
- Cost spike early warning systems[4][6]

### **Cross-Functional Analytics**

Create unified views combining multiple system tables:
- Job performance correlated with cost efficiency[5][19]
- Data lineage impact on query performance[12][5]
- User activity correlation with resource consumption[10][5]
- Team-based cost allocation with performance metrics[5][6]

## Implementation Best Practices

### **Dashboard Architecture Strategy**

1. **Start with Pre-built Templates:** Import Databricks' pre-configured usage dashboard as a foundation[4][7]
2. **Leverage Community Resources:** Utilize comprehensive dashboard suites like the open-source Databricks Dashboard Suite[5]
3. **Implement Incremental Development:** Begin with billing dashboards, then expand to operational metrics[4][6]

### **Data Governance and Access Control**

- Ensure proper Unity Catalog permissions for system table access[1][2]
- Use embedded credentials for broader stakeholder access without exposing sensitive permissions[4][7]
- Implement row-level security for team-specific cost views[5][6]

### **Performance Optimization**

- Use serverless warehouses for dashboard queries when available[5][8]
- Implement efficient data refresh schedules based on system table retention periods[1][17]
- Create reference tables for improved query performance[5]

## Expected Business Impact

These comprehensive dashboards will provide stakeholders with:

**Immediate Cost Visibility:** Real-time spending insights enabling proactive budget management[4][6]

**Operational Efficiency:** Identification of underutilized resources and optimization opportunities[19][21]

**Data Governance:** Clear visibility into data asset usage and access patterns[14][15]

**Performance Optimization:** Detailed insights into query and job performance trends[20][19]

**Compliance Assurance:** Comprehensive audit trails and security monitoring capabilities[9][22]

By implementing this multi-faceted dashboard strategy, organizations can achieve complete observability across their Databricks platform, enabling data-driven decisions that optimize costs, improve performance, and ensure compliance while providing stakeholders with the insights they need for effective platform governance[14][15].
