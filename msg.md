Sure! Here’s the revised version using “thought” instead of “suggest”:

Hi Team,

I’m currently working on creating the job compute cluster policy for the demand forecasting project and thought of including the Cobalt 100 VM node type. This way, whenever the use case team runs the workflow, the compute cluster can be provisioned with the Cobalt 100 node type by default.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this approach—do you foresee any concerns or have any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!
