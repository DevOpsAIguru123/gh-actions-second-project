Resource Name Scope
Resources can have either:
	•	Global scope: Must be unique across all of Azure (like storage accounts)
	•	Resource Group scope: Must be unique only within the resource group (like virtual networks)
Additional Naming Considerations
	•	Resource names must be unique within their scope
	•	Some resources like virtual networks can share the same name if they’re in different resource groups
	•	Each resource can have up to 50 tags with:
	•	Tag key length: 512 characters
	•	Tag value length: 256 characters
